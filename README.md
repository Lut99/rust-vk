# rust-vk: A RAII-wrapper for ash
A wrapper crate around ash (and others) that provides a slightly more high-level, RAII implementation of (some of) Vulkan's structures.


## Installation
To use this crate in one of your projects, simply add:
```toml
rust-vk = { git = "https://github.com/Lut99/rust-vk" }
```
to your `Cargo.toml` file.

Optionally, you can select a specific version by adding:
```toml
rust-vk = { git = "https://github.com/Lut99/rust-vk", tag = "<VERSION>" }
```
where `<VERSION>` is the required version number.

Note that this crate uses semantic versioning. That means that any breaking change will always be reflected in the major version number.


## Usage
The documentation of this crate may be automatically generated by running:
```bash
cargo doc
```
in the source of this crate. Then, in your browser, navigate to:
```
file://<path-to-repo>/target/doc/rust_vk/index.html
```
You can then browse the documentation at your leisure.
